  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>Urban environmental toxicity is a difficult problem to confront. It often occurs over long periods of time, making
    it challenging to connect the contaminating source to the resulting impacts on human and environmental health and
    wellbeing. It is an issue that disproportionately affects the most vulnerable members of society: women, children,
    minorities, and
    low-income communities. Those who experience urban environmental toxicity are often saddled with the burden of
    "proving" they
    have been affected by contamination, before assitance is provided.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Project History and Goals</h3>
  <p>
    Beyond providing a visualization of where urban environmental toxicity is happening, this project is also about
    promoting the use of visual, community-based, participatory research to assist communities in their efforts to
    advocate for change.
    This project has its beginnings in my dissertation research, which was focused on the childhood lead epidemic in
    Milwaukee, Wisconsin as well as work done with my advisor as part of my Master's research, in Flint, Michigan
    following the long-term effects of the Flint Water Crisis. Both of these projects used a photovoice method, which is
    a type of participatory
    research that uses photos and narratives produced by community members to document the impact of a particular issue
    on their daily lives. It is my hope that this project will become an archive of photovoice and other visual, participatory 
    research projects that will connect people who have experienced infrastructural violence with others who understand what 
    they are going through and with researchers interested in helping their communities. 
  </p>  
    And for any researchers interested in learning more about photovoice as a tool for this kind of work, or who are interested in having their 
    research project added to this map, please contact me!
