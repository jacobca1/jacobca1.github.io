            <h1>Teaching the Next Generation</h1>
            <p>The lead crisis in Milwaukee has persisted through multiple generations. Participants' do not trust in
                the government's willingness or ability to end the lead epidemic, so they believe that the only way to
                protect their children (and future generations beyond them) is to teach kids how to keep themselves safe
                from lead.</p>

Not only do she love to eat, but she loves to cook, like, she gets up on her little chair like that and helps me. When I was taking photos for this, I had her take a picture and she took one of the refrigerator. When I asked why, she said &quot;Because we can&apos;t cook with lead. We got to keep lead out of our food.&quot; The other twin took a picture of the stove, and when I asked her, &quot;What do mommy do here?&quot; She was like, &quot;You cook, you cook all the food.&quot; So I asked &quot;Okay, well, how do lead play a role in this?&quot; And she pointed straight to the sink. So she knows, you know, from her point of view. I think it&apos;s important for her to have these learnings and lessons as she grows up, because she&apos;s going to remember this day when her height is finally above that stove. It&apos;s something that&apos;s going to stick with her when she cooks, that she has to cook with lead-free water. - Shyquetta M. ; descPosition: right;">

It&apos;s important to me because before all this happened, the children were baptized with water that was blessed, but it wasn&apos;t lead free, it wasn&apos;t safe. Now my pastor is more aware of the lead epidemic and makes sure all the kids are baptized in lead-free water, are drinking lead-free water, and everyone goes home with a lead-free kit. Because you want to make sure the newborn babies are as safe and healthy as possible. So even our pastor now is more aware of okay, have to make sure our kids are safe. I know everyone's taking this a lot more seriously now and I'm just so in awe, just to see that progress happening. - Deanna B.; descPosition: right;">

                    data-glightbox="title: Sharing Our Story; description: My son who was hospitalized for elevated blood lead levels actually wrote a book about what it was like to live with lead poisoning. In the book that he wrote, he made three different lead monsters, one for the paint, one for the soil and the windowsills, and one for the water. This drawing is the monster for the soil and the windowsills. I didn&apos;t know he really understood what was happening to him. But he understood where the lead was coming from. He drew pictures of himself, looking all sad and depressed, and I didn&apos;t want him to depict himself as sad, but I&apos;m glad that other kids get to see that this is how he felt when he was going through this. I think the best thing about my story being shared through his book is that the other kids get to hear from another child, &quot;This is what I went through. This is what&apos;s going on in our community.&quot;  Like, what better person to speak to kids than another kid? Let him tell his own story because who better to hear from, to let kids know what they&apos;re talking about, what they&apos;re fighting for, who they&apos;re speaking about?  -Deanna B.; descPosition: right;">

                    data-glightbox="title: Childhood Wonder; description: This lead ain&apos;t no joke. I mean, it&apos;s everywhere, it&apos;s in the school down the street from me, Hopkins, that&apos;s the school I went to all the way to the sixth grade. Now, I&apos;m wondering, is that why some kids, you know, had problems like we had? Because we would go to the water bubbler, and we were drinking lead and we didn't know it. I know the school is older than my house- this&apos;s the school I went to, and my older sisters went there too. I mean, how many kids were affected going through this school building and didn&apos;t get recognized? There needs to be more testing, and they need to check out older kids too. They need to check some kids right now that they say are having behavioral problems in school because it could be they have been affected and they don&apos;t know it. And everybody else will write it off as &quot;They're bad.&quot; All these kids ain&apos;t bad. It&apos;s something in their brain that they can&apos;t control. So yeah, it makes me think, how many of us have been affected through lead and we didn't know it?  â€“ Ruby H.; descPosition: bottom;">

                    data-glightbox="title: Lead-Free Education; description: My oldest son, having lead exposure, he goes through a lot of struggles with learning at school, to the point where he doesn&apos;t understand any of it. Every day he&apos;s at least 30 minutes late because I have to talk him out of the car. Can you imagine pulling up to school and having to have a heart to heart and cry every single morning with your child just to get them to get out of the car? I do this every day.  So I took this picture because when we&apos;re at home, I meet my children where they&apos;re at and we have family learning time; we utilize a lot of different tools. This is just some of it, we play games, learning games, each of these boxes is a different subject. And I educate my children about lead, too even my four-year-olds. If you ask them what is lead poisoning, they can tell you the kids version of what it is. If you ask them, where do you find it? Where do you need to be careful with it? They can point to a windowsill. They can point to the dust on the fan. They can point to the sink. So we learn about lead exposure as a family, too. -Shyquetta M.; descPosition: bottom;">
