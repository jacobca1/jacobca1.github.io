                Milwaukee, Wisconsin has struggled with childhood lead poisoning in its North Side neighborhoods for decades.
                Although the numbers have declined over time, this issue continues to affect a disproportionate number of 
                African American and Latino children each year. Childhood lead poisoning can cause permanent neurological 
                damage including behavioral issues and learning disabilities. Despite the considerable possibility of exposure,
                many parents are unaware of the dangers and possible sources of lead. In 2018, COLE Parents Lead, a parent
                education and advocacy arm of the Coalition on Lead Emergency, was formed to bring awareness to this issue
                within their community and to put pressure on lawmakers to take serious steps towards removing lead from 
                their environment.

                This digital exhibit is part of a photovoice project coordinated by COLE Parents Lead and a researcher 
                from Michigan State University, in the Spring of 2022. It asked affected community members to answer the
                question "How does lead affect your daily life?" Participants took photos that answered this question
                and worked with the researcher to develop narratives that give insight into what the images represent. As a 
                group, the participants then sorted the photos into categories that capture what they believe to be the most
                important aspects of living with lead. Click on the themes below to jump to the exhibit sections.
