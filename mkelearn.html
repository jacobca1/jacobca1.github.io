            <p>Participants in this project have had to teach themselves about what it means to live in a
                lead-contaminated environment. They have learned everything they can about potential sources, solutions,
                and long-term impacts of lead poisoning. However, they feel a sense of frustration that so few people in
                the broader Milwaukee community, the government, and the medical establishment fully understand what the
                dangers are. This series of images is intended to capture both the things that people need to be aware
                of about the lead epidemic and the efforts of COLE Parents Lead to increase that awareness.</p>

But growing up as a child, when we bought these blinds to put up, they were made out of metal that was full of lead, and we didn&apos;t know that. And how many times you got a kid looking out the window? And I know I touched plenty of blinds growing up, looking outside at different things. So I&apos;m glad we got plastic blinds now. That&apos;s my grandson&apos;s hand. Now, imagine if he was little and I wasn&apos;t paying him no attention? He&apos;s playing with the blind. Which he do cause he always got to look out the back window, for his grandad. So these blinds, these are a change for the better.<br> <strong>-Ruby H.<strong>; descPosition: right;">

                    data-glightbox="title: Speaking Out; description: Speaking about lead and talking to other parents not only helps the community by bringing awareness, but it helps other parents know that you&apos;re not in this alone. Because I thought that it was an embarrassment on my behalf and my child&apos;s behalf, and I was ashamed of it. Until my pastor encouraged me to start speaking. And that&apos;s when I realized so many other parents were going through exactly what I went through, if not even worse, and I&apos;m like, &quot;Wow, this is really happening everywhere and no one&apos;s doing anything about it?&quot; Now I feel like I have to say something. There is no safe level of lead to be in a child&apos;s blood, and there was so much I didn&apos;t know. My mother always taught me to boil the water that will fix everything, that&apos;s one myth that I learned right away. And that by breastfeeding you can pass the lead to your child from birth. It&apos;s just so much I didn&apos;t know that I wish I had known. I want to educate parents and let them know what to look out for and how to protect their kids from lead, so no child has to be hospitalized.<br>  <strong>-Deanna B.<strong> ; descPosition: bottom;">

                    data-glightbox="title: How Many Children Were Affected Here?; description: This is he block I grew up on. As a child, it was a house right here where this fence is at. But all these houses were there. My house is across the street. When my grandson tested high for lead they came in and told us, first of all, the carpet was old. They said the carpet needed to come up. They said take the blinds down. And they told us to vacuum the windows out and they told us to take duct tape if you got a crack and cover it. You can take duct tape around your window and it will pull up all your loose paint because it&apos;s sticky. But how many of us grew up in these houses? Played in these houses. Drank that water out of these houses. And were we affected or not? From this fence on every one of these houses was duplexes. So it was double families in them, who all could have been affected.<br> <strong>-Ruby H.<strong>; descPosition: right;">

                    data-glightbox="title: You Just Don&apos;t Know; description: I rent, so I don&apos;t even know how old my apartment is. My concern is that I just don&apos;t know what things in my place are made out of and my daughter especially is always putting her hands and things in her mouth. So this is my closet door, and I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s lead-based finishing or not, or what metals that the brackets are made of. I wonder what my refrigerator door is made out ofâ€¦ I don&apos;t know what. It&apos;s an old refrigerator, so it could be a lead-based coating on there. I don&apos;t know. The cabinet fixtures, the paint on the cabinets, things like that.  I feel like landlords aren&apos;t keeping up to code with what they got to do. Like the lead testing, updating piping, even giving out information that this is how old the house is, and this is the things that&apos;s been done to the house. These are the updates, these are some downgrades, stuff like that. I think that is helpful when you&apos;re renting and trying to figure out if it&apos;s safe. Those are things you can think about to decide whether you want to rent this house out or not. <br> <strong>-Derrick M.<strong>; descPosition: right;">

                    data-glightbox="title: Is It Safe to Rest?; description: It&apos;s hard for my grandbabies to sit still and they&apos;re so overactive that being around other people socially, it&apos;s really hard. I have to take them to parks that have, you know, the rubbery ground, so they won&apos;t get hurt so much when they&apos;re running around. I chose this picture because when they&apos;re playing at the playground, Miguelito gets exhausted fast.  He deals with a lot of health issues, so he rests a lot when he&apos;s playing. But then, the ground, that&apos;s the rubbery ground. And it&apos;s great, but I wonder what materials is it made of? Is it safe for him to lay there? I know it&apos;s made of tires, but what are tires really made of? Rubber and what else? I worry because, if you&apos;re living in a house and you know, you have a gas leak, you&apos;re going you&apos;re going to smell it. But with lead, how do you know it&apos;s there? It&apos;s like a silent killer.<br> <strong>-Maria B.<strong>; descPosition: right;">

Every time I got in the shower, when I got out of the shower, I would just break out everywhere, I had to actually go buy like some cream and I went to the doctor and everything because my whole entire body was just getting spots on it. Then a couple of years later, they had to do an entire remodel of that place because of the lead levels when they did a lab test. So there&apos;s always that uncertainty about my pipes. It definitely makes me think about my water now, you know, just what&apos;s even coming out of your shower? Like, I use this every day. Is it safe?<br> <strong>-Zipporah T.<strong>; descPosition: right;">
