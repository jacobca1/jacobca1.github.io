            <p>A multitude of distrusts shape participants' experiences of the lead crisis. A deep
                distrust of government systems is intertwined with the distrust of their infrastructure, their home
                environment, and even their children's toys. The suspicion is that lead could be anywhere, and as there
                is no definitive list of safe or unsafe places and things, it's best to assume that nothing can be
                trusted.</p>

                    data-glightbox="title: Don&apos;t Drink from The Faucet!; description:I don&apos;t let them let my kids drink water from the faucet. We stopped that a while ago. We use pitchers and I use bottled water. When we go to bed at night, everybody knows to look in the refrigerator and get a bottle of water. The new foster kids that came in, I started hearing them getting up, going to the bathroom at night. And so one day I asked them, I said, &quot;Why y&apos;all keep going in that bathroom so much?&quot; They said, &quot;We be going for water.&quot; I said, &quot;Oh, no! Don&apos;t do that. Don&apos;t get the water out the bathroom no more. Please always come down. Look in the refrigerator, get your bottled water. Drink it from the bottle, not from the sink. I said brushing your teeth, taking a bath or shower, that&apos;s all you do with that water. Nothing else.<br> <strong>-Ledora M.<strong>; descPosition: bottom;">

                    data-glightbox="title: Proof; description: It wasn&apos;t until my son was hospitalized twice, and I did my research on my own that we understood what was really happening, what was really going on with lead. By that time it was too late, and it just made me feel like I was pretty much on my own, alone. They put kind of all the blame on me. The landlord said, &quot;Oh, we fixed the windows now you can come back in.&quot; So I took my kid back to the house and then because of the medicine he was on, which makes you more susceptible to lead if you&apos;re exposed to it again, the second time was even worse than the first time. At that point the CPS got involved and made me feel like I was a bad mother for letting my child get sick again and going back into that environment. I felt like that, too, so I broke my lease. Now the landlord is after me. I just found out I almost didn&apos;t get the apartment that I am in now because my landlord was suing for breaking my lease. I had to give them the lead report to prove what I&apos;m saying was true. It&apos;s a good thing I had saved this, otherwise I wouldn&apos;t be in the place I am in now.<br> <strong>-Deanna B.<strong>; descPosition: right;">

                    data-glightbox="title: Fun, But Dangerous; description: We got to watch what toys we get. Make sure you mostly get stuff that&apos;s plastic for your child. So your child won&apos;t be, you know, putting lead in their mouth and try to keep their toys clean. I know our kids love toys, but this is a little toy watch, I think that watch probably got some lead in it vs. the plastic toys that my grandbabies play with. This yoyo. I don&apos;t let my kids play with yoyos because the middle piece in yoyos contain lead. I found out it was one of the lead toys. I keep a list of toys. Somebody gave it to me, when we was talking about lead- when they were first telling us about the fidget spinners with that piece of metal in them. And then they showed me a couple of other toys that my friend had looked up that had lead in them. We got to be cautious of what our babies and our kids is puttin in they mouth. We just got to try to watch it.<br> <strong>-Ruby H.<strong>; descPosition: right;">

                    data-glightbox="title: Not Just Talking, Doing; description: I got to film a commercial about the lead issue and during the filming of the commercial, they took me to the place where this guy was working in terrible weather, it was rainy and he was still out there working on the lead laterals in the neighborhood of 53206. That was just great to see that. There were so many people working to make sure that these homes were safe and they gave me hope that somebody is really listening. They&apos;re really doing the actual work. It looks great to go meet the vice president and have her say &quot;Oh this is what we&apos;re going to do.&quot; It&apos;s not the same as when you actually see it get done and see they actually are trying to make a difference after so much time that we spent talking about it and talking about advocating for it.<br> <strong>-Deanna B.<strong>; descPosition: bottom;">

                    data-glightbox="title: Good Hygiene, Bad Water; description: I have to brush my teeth every day, I have to have good hygiene, so this is a reminder that our water is an everyday essential to our life. At one point our water at home was actually coming out brown, so we have a Britta pitcher that we put in our fridge, and we now have a filter on our kitchen sink which my mom kind of removes every now and again, but I brush my teeth in the kitchen just because I know that that water is going through a filter. Sometimes I use water from the pitcher in the refrigerator if she doesn&apos;t have the filter on the sink. It&apos;s kind of sad to say, but it&apos;s in my everyday life. So on an everyday basis, I don&apos;t really think about how lead might be going into my system. It crosses your mind, of course, but it&apos;s like, &quot;What can I do now? I&apos;ve already been affected.&quot; This picture is about intentionally remembering what I&apos;m putting into my body and how I&apos;m being affected.<br> <strong>-Laresha L.<strong>; descPosition: bottom;">
