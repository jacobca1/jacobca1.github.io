            <h1>Always Having to Fight</h1>
            <p>Coping with lead exposure on a daily basis is a constant battle. It is exhausting and traumatizing in a
                hundred different ways. From people's efforts to reduce exposure in any way they can, to the struggle of
                getting an education when you have learning disabilities, to the physical and behavioral effects of lead
                poisoning that have to be managed on an ongoing basis, we can see that battle in these images.</p>

I have to have this [beanbag] for them in the living room because when they did OT, there was a big bag like that that they got to jump on because it stimulates them, and it calms them down. That&apos;s how Ricardo is, he&apos;s all over the place and jumping. It&apos;s the impulsiveness to take a leap, but it&apos;s the bravery of it too. To jump into something, without knowing what&apos;s going to happen. Are you going to fall and get hurt or be safe? And I think that&apos;s where we&apos;re safest from lead, is in the air. Even though it looks dangerous, what he&apos;s doing, it&apos;s his safe place. -Maria B.; descPosition: right;">

I took this photo of him because he was very into what he was doing, like it was stimulating his brain, even though it&apos;s really hard for him to stay still. It&apos;s part of the Mighty Small Moments movement. It&apos;s an area where the kids could go in a WIC office, or other places, that they can interact. At this moment they were doing a press conference, and this was the room behind it. But the kids weren&apos;t distracted by the cameras or the all the people, they were more into getting their brain stimulated. It really impressed me and, the way he colored it, with such focus, it justâ€¦ it touched me. -Maria B.; descPosition: right;">

I kind of trust my water, because I got some lead test strips from the church and they didn&apos;t go up that high. So it ain&apos;t so much that but, I don&apos;t know. If you can take one thing out of your life, you know, maybe it&apos;ll help. I mean, we can&apos;t cure everything, but... You have control of, and you can kind of sort of watch your water, you know? So I got a pitcher of water sitting downstairs. My grandson gets his water out of there, I fill his water bottle up a lot. I use water filters. I buy a lot of bottled water.  This is the filter in my refrigerator and the man who installed it told us it gets lead out your water as well. It comes out a little slow, but it&apos;s a step towards healthiness and moving to a better life.  - Ruby H.; descPosition: right;">

                    data-glightbox="title: Attention Deficit; description: I wonder, you know, if it wasn&apos;t for the amount of lead exposure I had when I was younger, just how my life experience would have been different, because I did struggle, especially with attention deficit and dyslexia. I&apos;ve been dealing with attention deficit since I was a kid. Literally from being a kid to college, just sitting down to read was hard. I love reading books, they&apos;re just so awesome! But, you know, and especially in stressful situations, I&apos;ll sit down, I try to read a book and I literally cannot focus sometimes. So that&apos;s the struggle, just trying to really focus and I can&apos;t. Sometimes I read and I can read it three times without even realizing it. And the whole time you&apos;re reading it, you feel like you&apos;re just staring into blankness in space. I work from home right now, and I&apos;m trying to work but something as small as a pen will literally distract me. It&apos;s a long-term effect., it can get better, you know, if you kind of train yourself, but it doesn&apos;t go away. -Zipporah T.; descPosition: right;">

                    data-glightbox="title: Hospitalized, Again; description:I don&apos;t really feel like I&apos;d even know what lead was, or been as aware of it, as I was, if it wasn&apos;t for my youngest son. He was severely impacted to the point where he had to be hospitalized twice. We found that out during a routine lead check at the WIC office, and they recommended that he go to his pediatrician to get more extensive blood work. But by the time the results came back he was already hospitalized. His brother, because he was older, his levels went down pretty fast. They got from 20 at the highest all the way down to two. So he&apos;s doing great. But my younger son, his got to his bones, so he was slower to recover. I think his count was around 50 when he got hospitalized for the second time. It&apos;s down to 12 or 15 now. He&apos;s doing good, technically still lead poisoned but compared to where he&apos;s been... He was diagnosed with ADHD and ODD I think a year after he was diagnosed with lead poisoning.  For a while he had to have lead level checks every two weeks, then every month, now it&apos;s only once a year and I know he&apos;s happy about that. You know, no kid wants to be poked by needles, but he was traumatized. -Deanna B.; descPosition: right;">
